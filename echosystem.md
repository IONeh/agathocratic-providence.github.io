CIVILIZATION TYPES BASED ON VIEW OF THIE ECOSYSTEM
The types are based on how the civilization survives, on what they consume, and their symbiosis with their own nature beings on their planet or planets. This hypotheticl scale shows the probability of destroying its own civilization or environment, paralel to the paradox of Fermy there are civilization that their mentility may stop or accelarate their destruction the more technology they have. The precentage it’s an aproximated calculus using the amount of poluation and lack of mentall awarness statisticaly the civilization would have about they treat the environment, now it doesn’t matter if humans treat their food humanley because they still view their ecosystem as food, not as equal. I made assumtion based on their mentality of what religion they woul possibly beileve in, altough it is just an assumption.

TYPE  0 ‘Hell’> Utter suffering(rarely or impossible to see on our planet, based on survival by suffering, a simmilar but not an exact example is like how the neuronal cells of depressed/mentaly ill people require the suffering of their host in order to be happy) 90-99% of destruction its own world.
They would certainly be religious, and would be based on suffering, like most religions on our planet.

TYPE 1 ‘Purgatory’> Predation(snakes on mices, any civilization that have predates on all lifeforms, in our case including mices, dogs and cats or even other hummans) 85-90% 
There would be a lack of religion or a very speciesist religion. 

TYPE 2 ‘Distopy’> Competition(the million spermatozoids) 75-80% the earliest mondial possible destruction of hummans was the momment was between the second world war when the nazis could have invented the nuclear rockets to when Stanislav Petrov chosed to not launch the nuclear rokets, the humanity still treats its own species as adversars rather then friends. 
There maybe a mix of egotistical and discriminatory religion and atheism. They may treat themselves better then other animals and have laws, , but they are still competitive and individualist with their own species.

TYPE 3 ‘Invasion’> Parasitism(worms or viruses), a civilization that destroys and exploits its environment to the point of destruction} 70-75%
There would be a religion based on the god of war.

TYPE 4 ‘Dictatorship’> Antibiosis(trees and the grass around them), a civilization that poluates its environment in order to survive in the way they want.} 60-70%
Their religion would be self-centered, the civilization may think they are gods. They would respect its own species but not the other animals.

TYPE 5 ‘Masquerade’> Mimicry, Camouflage or Shapeshifting( animals that mimic the other animals in order to live between them and cheating by eating thier food ) } 50%
There would be a lack of religion, and they would be opportunistic. If they have a religion, maybe their god would be one of mischieving like Loki. Humans have the ability to mimicry and camouflage but they are not cooperating like the type 5 with the beings they could mimicry, and also they cannot shapeshift.

TYPE 6 ‘Mercantopy’> Cleaning symbiosis(small animal eats the parasits of a bigger one, it is a mutual exploitation, a civilization that helps its environment deal with its cleaning problems, like when a human takes a sheep’s fur for egotistical reason but also helping the sheep) 35-40%
There would be a lack of religion or a religion based on helping, maybe a sibling-like religion.

TYPE 7 ‘Laissez-faire’> Commensalism( barnacles and whales, or hermit crabs using gastropods, or spiders on plants) a civilization exploiting the environment leaving it unaffected} 20-30 %
Either a lack of religion or a religion based on helping, maybe a mother god.

TYPE 8 ‘Zymolaborant’> Symbiotic fermentation(vegemite, yeast) a civilization eating of the works of laboratory bacteries or robots. They view only unicelular beings as inferior } 15-20%
A lack of religion, a very scientifcal species.

TYPE 9 ‘Utopy’> Mutualism(bees with nectar, or some fungi and algae, or accacia ants and Accacias) a civilization based on mutual relationship with its environment, every living being benefitting. } 5-10%
A religion simmilar to the buddistic, spinosa, spiritualistic and philosophical idea of the universe, the population would have complete lack of selfishness and Ego. But in contact with a civilization lower then 5, then they may get destroyed if they are not enough advanced to defend. They also no longer need political laws because they have moral laws.

TYPE 10 ‘Heaven’> Neutralism(like plants) they produce their own food.} 0-5 %
If they had a religion they would become angels or enlighted already. If they not they would be very scientific.

All are either SUBTYPE A obligate or SUBTYPE B facultative, a civilization higher then 10 can become or are entities based on pure energy with no need to produce in order to survive or based on living from the pleasure other beings have, a civilization lower then 0 it is more probable that will destroy itself, but if it has the technology or if they were born entities with energy like FIRE, then they would destroy what ever they meet in their ways, or try to manipulate the emotion of beings to hurt them. Although there is no scientific proof that an immaterial being could exist.

Maybe you cannot calculate which type is a certain civilization but based on the points meet by the civilization you can make an aproximation

Humans are primarly type 2 distopy, their civilization having also small groups based on Type 1(people that eat any live animals), 0(people that have mentall illnes or addictions), 3(they are parasitic to their home planet), 4(they poluate their environment) and 6(they use sheep fur), their subtype is B facultative, as they consume and use all the animal inferior lifeforms from their planet willingly, they are also competitive with their own species, they were previously a subtype A obligate, but now with technology they can change it to type 9 or 7 but they wont, as they need to change their own competitive unempathetic mindset, to a more peacefull symbiotic relationship with their environment. The vegetarian and vegan population is still a type 1 or 2 as they eat living being from the vegetal regnum, but they have more empathy. In order for humanity to become a type 9, 8 or 7, it would need a technology that created food like how bees create honey without the need to kill a living being like how cows eat grass to create milk. Humanity started to create cultured meat in the lab which is a behaviour of a civilization that changes to type 9,8 or 7. In order to reach type 10, humanity would need a technology to no longer need to eat but only to make their body produce energy by itself from sun or other resources. Humanity do not have the technology to reach type 1. No alien higher then 5 would come and visit us because they would assume that we are a danger, but civilizations lower then that would come to us but is hard to see a civilization like us wanting peace and not to just exploit the resources like we do, a civilization like that consumes lower life forms no matter the level of consciousness of the lower life forms, as an example are the animals with different levels of inteligence that scream not wanting to die, while we still kill them, if you belive an alien would not kill a species that can create technology do not forget about the cannibals that eat their visitors. That still doesn’t mean a higher peacefull civilization wouldn’t come, maybe they will think one day we are enough peacefull to visit us. The work is not meant to judge our selves, i am not saying here that we are made evil or monsters, but rather that we must find a better way of survival and not be blocked by our own subjective experience, there is no good or bad human, its just that we were born on a unlucky planet with a nature that preferred competition in order to transfer the proteins in a cycle of life, and with bodies that consumes other beings. We need to change that, to stop seeing our fellow humans or animals or plants as inferior or as enemies. We need to respect everything if we want to evoluate. To stop seeing people from prison as evil, or others as good, no one is better.
