CIVILIZATION TYPES BASED ON VIEW OF THIE ECOSYSTEM
The types are based on how the civilization survives, on what they consume, and their symbiosis with their own nature beings on their planet or planets. This hypotheticl scale shows the probability of destroying its own civilization or environment, paralel to the paradox of Fermy there are civilization that their mentility may stop or accelarate their destruction the more technology they have. The precentage it’s an aproximated calculus using the amount of poluation and lack of mentall awarness statisticaly the civilization would have about they treat the environment, now it doesn’t matter if humans treat their food humanley because they still view their ecosystem as food, not as equal. I made assumtion based on their mentality of what religion they woul possibly beileve in, altough it is just an assumption.

TYPE  0 ‘Hell’> Utter suffering(rarely or impossible to see on our planet, based on survival by suffering, a simmilar but not an exact example is like how the neuronal cells of depressed/mentaly ill people require the suffering of their host in order to be happy, human body of smocker is quite such an ecosystem) 90-99% of destruction its own world.
They would certainly be religious, and would be based on suffering, like most religions on our planet.

TYPE 1 ‘Purgatory’> Predation(snakes on mices, any civilization that have predates on all lifeforms, in our case including mices, dogs and cats or even other hummans) 85-90% 
There would be a lack of religion or a very speciesist religion. 

TYPE 2 ‘Distopy’> Competition(from the moment of our birth on earth we have to compete with a milion spermatozoids to survive, a being on earth will always live in the detriment of others) 75-80% the earliest mondial possible destruction of hummans was the momment was between the second world war when the nazis could have invented the nuclear rockets to when Stanislav Petrov chosed to not launch the nuclear rokets, the humanity still treats its own species as adversars rather then friends. 
There maybe a mix of egotistical and discriminatory religion and atheism. They may treat themselves better then other animals and have laws, , but they are still competitive and individualist with their own species.

TYPE 3 ‘Invasion’> Parasitism(inspired by worms or viruses), a civilization that destroys and exploits its environment to the point of destruction} 70-75%
There would be a religion based on the god of war.

TYPE 4 ‘Dictatorship’> Antibiosis(inspired by trees and the grass around them), a civilization that poluates its environment in order to survive in the way they want.} 60-70%
Their religion would be self-centered, the civilization may think they are gods. They would respect its own species but not the other animals.

TYPE 5 ‘Masquerade’> Mimicry, Camouflage or Shapeshifting( animals that mimic the other animals in order to live between them and cheating by eating thier food ) } 50%
There would be a lack of religion, and they would be opportunistic. If they have a religion, maybe their god would be one of mischieving like Loki. Humans have the ability to mimicry and camouflage but they are not cooperating like the type 5 with the beings they could mimicry, and also they cannot shapeshift.

TYPE 6 ‘Mercantopy’> Cleaning symbiosis(small animal eats the parasits of a bigger one, it is a mutual exploitation, a civilization that helps its environment deal with its cleaning problems, like when a human takes a sheep’s fur for egotistical reason but also helping the sheep) 35-40%
There would be a lack of religion or a religion based on helping, maybe a sibling-like religion.

TYPE 7 ‘Laissez-faire’> Commensalism(inspired by barnacles and whales, or hermit crabs using gastropods, or spiders on plants) a civilization exploiting the environment leaving it unaffected} 20-30 %
Either a lack of religion or a religion based on helping, maybe a mother god.

TYPE 8 ‘Zymolaborant’> Symbiotic fermentation(inspired by the idea of vegemite, yeast) imagine a civilization eating of the works of laboratory bacteries or robots. 
They view only unicelular beings as inferior } 15-20%
A lack of religion, a very scientifcal species(possibly).

TYPE 9 ‘Utopy’> Mutualism(bees with nectar, or some fungi and algae, or accacia ants and Accacias) a civilization based on mutual relationship with its environment, every living being benefitting. } 5-10%
A religion simmilar to the buddistic, spinosa, spiritualistic and philosophical idea of the universe, the population would have complete lack of selfishness and Ego. But in contact with a civilization lower then 5, then they may get destroyed if they are not enough advanced to defend. They also no longer need political laws because they have moral laws.

TYPE 10 ‘Heaven’> Neutralism(like plants) they produce their own food.} 0-5 %
If they had a religion they would become angels or enlighted already. If they not they would be very scientific.

All are either SUBTYPE A obligate or SUBTYPE B facultative, a civilization higher then 10 can become or are entities based on pure energy with no need to produce in order to survive or based on living from the pleasure other beings have, a civilization lower then 0 it is more probable that will destroy itself, but if it has the technology or if they were born entities with energy like fire(which is not living but is close to my idea), then they would destroy what ever they meet in their ways, or try to manipulate the emotion of beings to hurt them. Although there is no scientific proof that an immaterial being could exist.

Maybe you cannot calculate which type is a certain civilization but based on the points meet by the civilization you can make an aproximation

Humans are primarly type 2 distopy, their civilization having also small groups based on Type 1(people that eat any live animals), 0(people that have mentall illnes or addictions), 3(they are parasitic to their home planet), 4(they poluate their environment) and 6(they use sheep fur), their subtype is B facultative, as they consume and use all the animal inferior lifeforms from their planet willingly, they are also competitive with their own species, they were previously a subtype A obligate, but now with technology they can change it to type 9 or 7 but they wont, as they need to change their own competitive unempathetic mindset, to a more peacefull symbiotic relationship with their environment. The vegetarian and vegan population is still a type 1 or 2 as they eat living being from the vegetal regnum, but they have more empathy. In order for humanity to become a type 9, 8 or 7, it would need a technology that created food like how bees create honey without the need to kill a living being like how cows eat grass to create milk. Humanity started to create cultured meat in the lab which is a behaviour of a civilization that changes to type 9,8 or 7. In order to reach type 10, humanity would need a technology to no longer need to eat but only to make their body produce energy by itself from sun or other resources. Humanity do not have the technology to reach type 1. No alien higher then 5 would come and visit us because they would assume that we are a danger, but civilizations lower then that would come to us but is hard to see a civilization like us wanting peace and not to just exploit the resources like we do, a civilization like that consumes lower life forms no matter the level of consciousness of the lower life forms, as an example are the animals with different levels of inteligence that scream not wanting to die, while we still kill them, if you belive an alien would not kill a species that can create technology do not forget about the cannibals that eat their visitors. That still doesn’t mean a higher peacefull civilization wouldn’t come, maybe they will think one day we are enough peacefull to visit us. The work is not meant to judge our selves, i am not saying here that we are made evil or monsters, but rather that we must find a better way of survival and not be blocked by our own subjective experience, there is no good or bad human, its just that we were born on a unlucky planet with a nature that preferred competition in order to transfer the proteins in a cycle of life, and with bodies that consumes other beings. We need to change that, to stop seeing our fellow humans or animals or plants as inferior or as enemies. We need to respect everything if we want to evoluate. To stop seeing people from prison as evil, or others as good, no one is better.


Below is a proposal for a system—a framework and calculation model—that aims to quantify and classify a civilization’s type based on its survival strategy, consumption patterns, and overall relationship (or “symbiosis”) with its environment. This system blends numeric indices and qualitative factors (like assumed religious or ideological orientiation) under the premise that a civilization’s “destruction propensity” (the likelihood of self-destructive behavior toward its environment or itself) is a function of its population pressures, technological consumption, and mental (or ethical) awareness.
Below is one way to design such a system.

---

## 1. Define Key Metrics

### A. Population Pressure Index (PPI)  
- **Purpose:** Quantify how the size and growth of the civilization’s population strain its planetary resources.  
- **Measurement:**  
  - Normalize the population against the estimated ecological carrying capacity.  
  - For example, if a population is at 150% of what the planet can sustainably support, then PPI might be 1.5 on a scale where 1 is “balanced” and values above 1 indicate increasing pressure.

### B. Technological Consumption Factor (TCF)  
- **Purpose:** Reflect the intensity of resource use and technological exploitation.  
- **Measurement:**  
  - Could be derived from metrics such as rate of resource extraction, energy consumption per capita, or pollution indices.  
  - Normalization puts this on a scale where higher values denote higher consumption/extraction.

### C. Mental Awareness and Ethical Index (MAEI)  
- **Purpose:** Represent the civilization’s awareness of its environmental, social, and ethical responsibilities.  
- **Measurement:**  
  - Can be estimated from surveys, educational levels, or the “ethical” content of cultural productions and policies.[*]  
  - This index is set so that higher values represent greater ethical/moral awareness.  
  - It is crucial to note that a “lack” of mental awareness (i.e., low MAEI) increases the risk—even under high technology and population pressures.

*Note: These indices are conceptual. In practice, they would need concrete quantitative proxies (for example, ecological footprint per capita, rate of renewable energy uptake, or standardized environmental behavior surveys).*

## 2. Constructing the Destruction Propensity Formula

We posit that the civilization’s probability (or propensity) for self-destruction of its own civilization/environment (DS: Destruction Score) is a function of population and technology pressures weighed against mental awareness. One possible (simplified) formula is:

   DS = (α × PPI + β × TCF) ÷ (γ × MAEI)

Where:  
- α, β, and γ are weight factors that you can calibrate based on how strongly you believe each parameter affects destruction likelihood.  
- DS is normalized to a percentage scale from 0% (minimal self-destructive risk) to 100% (maximum risk).

For example, one might set α = 0.4, β = 0.5, and γ = 1.0 (if you think technological exhaustion slightly outweighs population pressure), but these numbers can be adjusted once real data or more refined assumptions are available.

## 3. Incorporating Qualitative Factors

The civilization type—as described in your list—is not determined solely by DS; cultural and religious attitudes are also assumed to correlate with each type. One way to incorporate these is by associating “assumed mental frameworks” with ranges of DS, acknowledging that civilizations with very high DS tend to develop religions or ideologies of suffering or predation, while those with low DS lean toward mutualism or neutralism.

Thus, after computing DS, you map the value to a type based on the following approximate ranges:

| Civilization Type | Label        | DS Range (%) | Characteristics (Assumed)                                          |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type 0            | "Hell"       | 90–99        | Utter suffering; survival based on suffering; heavily religious; similar to a network where negativity is inherent (akin to depressed neuronal cells).* |
| Type 1            | "Purgatory"  | 85–90        | Predation on all life forms; minimal or speciesist religion          |
| Type 2            | "Distopy"    | 75–80        | Extreme competition and internal conflict; a mix of egotism and discriminatory moral codes |
| Type 3            | "Invasion"   | 70–75        | Parasitic exploitation of the environment; religion centered on war  |
| Type 4            | "Dictatorship"| 60–70       | Antibiosis (polluting in isolation for survival); self-aggrandizing religion emphasizing the supremacy of one’s own kind |
| Type 5            | "Masquerade" | ~50          | Mimicry or camouflage; opportunistic and mix of hidden cooperation and exploitation; religion (if present) might be mischievous |
| Type 6            | "Mercantopy" | 35–40        | Cleaning symbiosis; mutual exploitation where the society also “helps” the environment (at least partially) |
| Type 7            | "Laissez-faire"| 20–30      | Commensalism; exploiting without affecting the environment significantly; may have a nurturing or mother-god style belief structure |
| Type 8            | "Zymolaborant"| 15–20      | Symbiotic fermentation; technological and scientific focus; viewing unicellular or simpler forms as inferior |
| Type 9            | "Utopy"      | 5–10         | Mutualism; complete integration with the environment; minimal selfishness; philosophical/religious outlooks similar to Buddhism/spinozism |
| Type 10           | "Heaven"     | 0–5          | Neutralism; fully self-sustaining, producing their own needs with minimal environmental interference; almost angelic or enlightened/ultra-scientific |

*These descriptions are based on your assumptions and can be refined further.

## 4. Accounting for Subtypes

You also mentioned subtypes:  
- **Subtype A (Obligate):** Civilizations that inherently follow their calculated mode (they are “locked” into a survival mode defined by DS and its cultural manifestation).  
- **Subtype B (Facultative):** Civilizations that can adapt or shift strategies under certain conditions (their DS might change over time as they learn or modify their technology consumption).

One way to incorporate this is to allow the DS to be dynamic. For instance, if a civilization invests in significant education or ethical reform:
- Their MAEI increases over time.
- Their DS decreases, potentially shifting subtypes.

The system could include a “subtype modifier” factor, such that:  
   DS_effective = DS × (1 – δ × (Change in MAEI))  
Where δ reflects how adaptable the civilization is. A higher adaptability factor means that investments in mental awareness or technology restraint more quickly reduce DS.

## 5. Example Calculation

Imagine a hypothetical civilization with:  
- PPI = 1.2 (20% above sustainable capacity)  
- TCF = 0.9 on a scale where 1 is high consumption  
- MAEI = 0.6 on a scale of 0–1 (indicating moderate ethical awareness)

Using assumed constant values (α = 0.5; β = 0.5; γ = 1.0), the DS would be:

   DS = (0.5 × 1.2 + 0.5 × 0.9) ÷ (1.0 × 0.6)  
     = (0.6 + 0.45) ÷ 0.6  
     = 1.05 ÷ 0.6 ≈ 1.75, or 175%

Since DS cannot exceed 100% in our model, you would cap DS at 100% so that this civilization is in the highest-risk group—in practice, one must adjust weights and scaling to keep DS in the 0–100 range. With proper calibration, this value might be rescaled to, say, 92%, which would classify the civilization as Type 0 ("Hell").

### Calculating MAEI for Humans

To calculate MAEI based on ecosystem perspective, we can use this framework:

**Ecosystem View Categories:**
1. View as suffering (Type 0) = 0.0-0.1
2. View as prey/food (Type 1) = 0.1-0.2
3. View as competition (Type 2) = 0.2-0.3
4. View as resource to exploit (Type 3-4) = 0.3-0.5
5. View as tool/product (Type 5-6) = 0.5-0.7
6. View as coexistence (Type 7-8) = 0.7-0.8
7. View as mutual benefit (Type 9) = 0.8-0.9
8. View as equal/one (Type 10) = 0.9-1.0

**Human Civilization Analysis:**
- Humans predominantly view ecosystem as products/resources to exploit [Quantifying the sustainability of human and natural systems: A novel ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925524003792)
- Current economic systems treat nature as commodity [Ecological Civilization—A revived perspective on the relationship ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352760889_Ecological_Civilization-A_revived_perspective_on_the_relationship_between_man_and_nature)
- Environmental degradation shows lack of ecological respect [Comparing eco-civilization theory and practice: Big-data evidence from ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622043268)
- Some progress toward ecological civilization but still far from implementation [Modelling human influences on biodiversity at a global scale–A human ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380021003926)

**Revised MAEI Calculation for Humans:**
Based on the predominant view of ecosystem as product/resource, humans would fall into the 0.3-0.5 range (Type 3-4 perspective).

MAEI = 0.4 (representing resource/product-based view)

This means humans are closer to Type 3 "Invasion" (parasitic relationship with environment) and Type 4 "Dictatorship" (antibiosis), rather than Type 0 "Hell" in the previous calculation.

**Therefore revised calculation:**
DS = (0.5 × 1.2 + 0.5 × 1.0) ÷ (1.0 × 0.4)
= (0.6 + 0.5) ÷ 0.4
= 1.1 ÷ 0.4
= 2.75 (raw score)

Converting to percentage: ~75%

This places human civilization around Type 2-3 ("Distopy"/"Invasion"), which aligns better with how humans treat their ecosystem - as something to compete with and exploit, rather than something to deliberately cause suffering to (Type 0) [Ecological civilization: perspectives from landscape ecology and ...](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-019-00772-4).


## 6. Final Steps and Considerations

- **Calibration:**  
  The weight factors (α, β, γ) and normalization choices need to be refined based on empirical data or deeper theoretical work. You might run simulations or historical analyses to see how well the model aligns with known civilizations’ behaviors.

- **Integration of Qualitative Data:**  
  While our model starts with quantitative inputs, integrating qualitative assessments (e.g., cultural surveys, religious tendencies) might be done through additional multiplier factors or “adjustment coefficients” that shift DS into the appropriate type range.

- **Dynamic Modeling:**  
  As civilizations evolve (for example, through reforms that raise MAEI), the model should allow DS to adjust over time. A time-dependent simulation model could show potential trajectories: a civilization might move from Type 2 to Type 7 if it invests in ethical education and sustainable technology.

- **Assumptions Transparency:**  
  Clearly document all assumptions (e.g., how “mental awareness” is measured, what proxies are used) so that the model can be critiqued and refined by others interested in this interdisciplinary approach.
